## ✒️ General Information 
Using vanilla CSS is awesome! It is just absolutely amazing what chef d'oeuvre you can create with Pure CSS and being able to share them to the world ([odin-recipes](https://github.com/MisterValiant/odin-recipes "Odin Recipes") and [odin-landing](https://github.com/MisterValiant/odin-landing "Odin Landing")) 'Shameless plug' 😂. 

However, as projects get more complex and with strict deadlines, it becomes crucial to use a framework or library in order to deliver more rapidly and efficiently.

<br/>

**🛈 About:**

Tailwind CSS ༄ is a huge collection of CSS utility classes. It allows you to write less code overall. However, Tailwind does not provide pre-built components like Bootstrap. Nevertheless, it gives much better control over customisation.

<br/>

## ❤️ Motivation
The main aim of learning Tailwind CSS is to experience the different CSS frameworks and libraries, and find a better and more beautiful way to efficiently code frontend or UI/UX components compared to pure CSS and Bootstrap.
